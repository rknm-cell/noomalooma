NoomaLooma Play Log ‚Äì Design Engineering Challenge
Vision
"How we spend our time is how we spend our lives" - we believe technology should help people notice, capture, and rediscover the small sparks of aliveness throughout their day.
Build an experience where you log playful moments ‚Äì log a moment to get a playful moment from another corner of the world, fun themed lookbacks of your log inspiring more play in the future, easter egg discovery (vs. endless scroll) to discover community play.

What We're Assessing
Design & Delight - Can you create interfaces that feel playful and spark joy?
Function - Does your code work well and solve real user problems?
Velocity - Can you deliver meaningful value within time constraints?


Your Mission
Build a prototype that captures four core experience flows around daily play moments:
1. Personal Play Logging
Create an interface for quickly capturing moments of play throughout the day:
Quick capture: Low-friction logging during busy moments
Rich context: Location, time, mood, play type, energy level
Micro-celebration: Make logging feel rewarding, not burdensome
2. Instant Moment Exchange
Design an immediate exchange system - log a moment to get a moment:
Instant gratification: Submit your moment, immediately receive someone else's play
Randomize surprise: No profiles or preferences, pure serendipity
Model Tiny Reciprocity: Every exchange requires contribution first
3. Easter Egg Discovery
Create hidden discovery mechanisms rather than feeds or endless scrolls. 
Surprise encounters: Stumble upon moments through exploration, not algorithms or endless feeds
Hidden connections: Find play happening through shared threads (Play at 2.47pm? Funny face selfies? Laundry dance?)
Treasure hunt feels: Discovery requires curiosity and interaction, not passive scrolling
4. Personal Play Log
Design personal viewing and reflection experiences:
Personal timeline: Browse your own moments by week/mood/ play type
Cadenced lookbacks/ memories/ rediscovery
Pattern insights: Gentle observations about when/where/how you play

Sample Play Moments
"Made silly faces in the bathroom mirror"
"Turned walking to lunch into a hop-skip rhythm"
"Played 'the floor is lava' while waiting for the elevator"
"Had a 30-second dance party while coffee brewed"
"Found a cool shadow to trace with my foot"

Core Principles
No social media mechanics: No followers, likes, or public profiles
Micro-moment focus: Quick logging during actual play, not retrospective journaling
Serendipitous exchange: Random connections create genuine surprise
Personal reflection: Help people see their own patterns of aliveness

Time Investment: 6 Hours Max
Design + Delight for 1-2 Core Flows. Rest as Working Prototype (Function + Velocity)
Option A: Logging + Instant Exchange
Option B: Logging + Personal Play Log
Option C: Easter Egg Discovery + Personal log lookbacks
Option D: Your own interpretation of the most important flows

For your chosen flows, show us: A) Thoughtful interface design that embodies playfulness, B) Smooth micro-interactions and transitions, C) How the technology serves the human experience. For the remaining flows, build functional prototype that demonstrate your technical thinking without polish. Mock data and simple interfaces are perfectly fine. < Use existing design system wherever possible ‚Äì link separately shared > 

Deliverables: Working Demo - Deploy your prototype where we can interact with it
Show us your interpretation of what makes daily life more alive. We want to see how you think about micro-moments, and interfaces that spark joy. Most importantly: Have FUN with this challenge!

Appendix 1
Starter Questions as you build:
How do you capture a moment without disrupting the moment itself?
What makes a moment exchange feel serendipitous?
How can design make logging feel special rather than obligatory?
How do you visualize someone's day or year of play in a delightful way? 
How do you create discovery that feels intentional without being algorithmic?
